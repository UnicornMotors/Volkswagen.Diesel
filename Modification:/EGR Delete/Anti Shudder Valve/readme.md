>Call it and anti shudder valve if you want, but the real reason it is there is for run away. If the motor starts to run away all you need to do is shut off the key and valve closes and does not allow it to get air. No air no run, take it out or defeat it and you are taking a chance. Without being able to shut off the air their would be nothing you could do about the thing running away.
